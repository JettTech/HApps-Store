### Installing

The app can now be started for **development** purposes using

```
npm run hc:win
```
**For Other OS:**
```
npm run hc:dev
```
and opening the browser to http://localhost:4141

If you would like to persist data between sessions install to the **local holochain directory** by running the following from the project root directory:
```
hcadmin init <id/name string>
hcadmin join ./build-HCHC/ HCHC
hcd HCHC
```
### Prerequisites
Ensure holochain-proto (at least version 26) is installed on your machine by running.
